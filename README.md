# NearAI
**We're building a platform where everyone can collaborate to create and improve AI models collectively. Contribute by anyone from anywhere and be part of shaping a smarter AI for all**

## Inspiration: How We Came Up with This Idea
We are AI students who’ve personally experienced the challenges of obtaining GPUs we simply couldn’t get enough resources at an affordable price. Initially, we built this platform for the ETHGlobal Bangkok hackathon, but we decided to pivot and continue building on the NEAR Protocol. Our vision and NEAR’s AI vision are aligned, as we both aim to make AI more open, accessible, and decentralized. NEAR’s fast and cost-effective infrastructure perfectly supports this mission, and the positive feedback from NEAR’s DevRel team (particularly Owen) further motivated us to move forward. With the ongoing AI controversy surrounding centralization, we believe AI models should not be monopolized by big corporations. While open-source models are meant to be freely available, these companies often impose restrictive blocks, limiting true accessibility and innovation. Our mission is to democratize AI development, ensuring that open-source AI remains truly open and accessible to everyone.

## The Problem
The AI space is highly fragmented, with major players like OpenAI, NVIDIA, Google, and Microsoft working in silos to develop better AI models or achieve AGI. This competitive, closed-off environment hinders collaboration and slows innovation. Moreover, training large-scale AI models demands significant GPU power, which is often limited and expensive even for leading companies like NVIDIA.

## The Solution
Imagine a world where individuals, organizations, and enterprises rather than operating separately, they pool their collective computational resources to train the same Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems. Our platform embodies this vision, allowing people worldwide to contribute processing power toward one shared, evolving AI model. This collaborative framework reduces costs, increases accessibility, and accelerates progress in AI research. By leveraging NEAR’s efficient smart contracts for transparent governance and fair rewards, we ensure that contributors are recognized and incentivized for their efforts in a decentralized ecosystem.

## How It Works
Our platform functions through two main approaches:

### 1. Open-Source Models
- **DAO-Driven Proposals**: DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) participants propose and vote on which models to train next.  
- **Public Datasets & Training**: Community members train models, such as image classifiers or language models, on widely available datasets like ImageNet. Once trained, all individual models are combined on our platform, creating a more powerful and refined AI system through decentralized collaboration. 
- **Reward Mechanism**: Contributors earn DAO tokens for their efforts. When these open-source models are used via an API, any stablecoin revenue is also shared among contributors based on their DAO token holdings.  

### 2. Closed-Source Models
- **Private Model Requests**: Enterprises or individuals list their proprietary models and datasets on the platform.  
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Data remains secure and confidential, enabling privacy-preserving computation throughout the training process. To enhance security and fairness, the dataset is split among all trainers, ensuring that no single participant has complete access to the full dataset while still contributing to the overall model’s development.  
- **Fair Compensation**: Contributors who assist with training receive stablecoin payments funded by the enterprise, along with additional DAO tokens as added incentives.  
- **DAO Utility**: DAO tokens earned can be used to vote on open-source initiatives, ensuring that even contributors to private models have a stake in the broader community’s direction.
