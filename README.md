## Problem

The AI space today is highly fragmented:

- Major players (OpenAI, NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft) build models in silos.  
- Barriers to collaboration slow down progress.  
- Training state-of-the-art models demands massive (and expensive) GPU resources.  

---

## Solution

Imagine a world where individuals, organizations, and companies pool their compute and expertise to train a single, shared AI model:

1. **Open-Source Models**  
   - Governed by a DAO: participants propose, vote on, and decide which models to train.  
   - Contributors earn DAO tokens to influence roadmap decisions.  

2. **Closed-Source Models**  
   - Clients list their proprietary models and datasets.  
   - Community helps train them in exchange for DAO coins or monetary rewards.  

All compute and model orchestration happens via smart contracts on-chain, ensuring transparency, fairness, and automation.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Collaboration**  
  Pool global compute resources to train models faster and more efficiently.  
- **DAO Governance**  
  Community-driven model selection, funding, and roadmap planning.  
- **Incentive Mechanisms**  
  Earn DAO tokens or payments for contributed compute and expertise.  
- **Smart Contracts**  
  Automated job scheduling, reward distribution, and progress tracking on-chain.

## Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

Both open-source and closed-source model training runs inside a TEE, ensuring:

- **Data Privacy**: Your datasets and model weights remain confidential.  
- **Secure Computation**: Guarantees code and data integrity during training.  
- **Auditability**: Verifiable logs of compute tasks and model updates.

### Q3 2025
- Develop **Complex Model Stacking** (hierarchical ensembles & meta-learning)  
- Enhance **DAO Voting** UX and tokenomics

### Q4 2025
- Integrate **Neural Network Editor & Visualizer**  
- Support advanced architectures (transformers, graph neural nets)
